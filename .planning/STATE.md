# GSD State: Spectre

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-22)

**Core value:** Enable AI assistants to understand what's happening in Kubernetes clusters through unified MCP interface—timeline queries, graph traversal, log exploration, and metrics analysis.
**Current focus:** Phase 16 - Ingestion Pipeline (Dashboard Sync & PromQL Parsing)

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 19 (v1.3 Grafana Metrics Integration)
Plan: 1 of 3 (Ingestion Pipeline)
Status: In progress - 16-01 complete (PromQL Parser)
Last activity: 2026-01-22 — Completed 16-01-PLAN.md (PromQL Parser)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 20% (1 of 5 phases complete in v1.3)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.3 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.15 hours

**Previous Milestones:**
- v1.2: 8 plans completed
- v1.1: 12 plans completed
- v1.0: 19 plans completed

**Cumulative:**
- Total plans: 39 complete (v1.0-v1.2)
- Milestones shipped: 3

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions from PROJECT.md affecting v1.3:
- Query via Grafana API (not direct Prometheus) — simpler auth, variable handling
- No metric storage — query historical ranges on-demand
- Dashboards are intent, not truth — treat as fuzzy signals
- Progressive disclosure — overview → aggregated → details

From Phase 15:
- SecretWatcher duplication (temporary) - refactor to common package deferred — 15-01
- Dashboard access required for health check, datasource access optional — 15-01
- Follows VictoriaLogs integration pattern exactly for consistency — 15-01
- Generic factory pattern eliminates need for type-specific switch cases in test handler — 15-03
- Blank import pattern for factory registration via init() functions — 15-03

From Phase 16:
- Use official Prometheus parser instead of custom regex parsing — 16-01
- Detect variable syntax before parsing to handle unparseable queries gracefully — 16-01
- Return partial extraction for queries with variables instead of error — 16-01
- Check for variables in both metric names and label selector values — 16-01

### Pending Todos

## Milestone History

- **v1.2 Logz.io Integration + Secret Management** — shipped 2026-01-22
  - 5 phases (10-14), 8 plans, 21 requirements
  - Logz.io as second log backend with SecretWatcher

- **v1.1 Server Consolidation** — shipped 2026-01-21
  - 4 phases (6-9), 12 plans, 21 requirements
  - Single-port deployment with in-process MCP

- **v1.0 MCP Plugin System + VictoriaLogs** — shipped 2026-01-21
  - 5 phases (1-5), 19 plans, 31 requirements
  - Plugin infrastructure + VictoriaLogs integration

## Tech Debt

- DateAdded field not persisted in integration config (from v1)
- GET /{name} endpoint unused by UI (from v1)

## Session Continuity

**Last command:** /gsd:execute-phase 16-01
**Context preserved:** Phase 16-01 complete (PromQL Parser), 6 requirements satisfied (PROM-01-06)

**Next step:** Continue Phase 16 with dashboard sync implementation (16-02)
