<objective>
Wire REST API into server startup and verify end-to-end integration with UI.

Purpose: Connect backend (Plan 02-01) and frontend (Plan 02-02) into working system. Server must pass config path and manager to handler registration. Human verification confirms full flow works.

Output: Running server with functional integration management UI and verified config persistence.

  <name>Task 1: Integrate config handler into server startup and verify hot-reload wiring</name>
  <files>
    cmd/spectre/commands/server.go
  </files>
  <action>
Update cmd/spectre/commands/server.go to pass config handler parameters:

1. Locate RegisterHandlers call (should be in server startup sequence)

2. Update RegisterHandlers call to include new parameters:
   ```go
   handlers.RegisterHandlers(
       router,
       // ... existing parameters (storageExecutor, graphExecutor, etc.)
       *integrationsConfig,     // config path from --integrations-config flag
       integrationManager,      // manager instance from Phase 1
   )
   ```

3. The --integrations-config flag and integrationManager already exist from Phase 1 (01-04-SUMMARY.md confirms server.go integration).

4. Verify parameter order matches RegisterHandlers signature from 02-01 Task 3.

5. Add verification step for hot-reload wiring:
   After server starts, test that WriteIntegrationsFile → file watcher → hot-reload chain works:

   ```bash
   # Start server in background
   ./spectre server --integrations-config ./integrations.yaml &
   SERVER_PID=$!

   # Wait for startup
   sleep 2

   # Create test integration via API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/config/integrations \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"test-reload","type":"victorialogs","enabled":true,"config":{"url":"http://localhost:9428"}}'

   # Check server logs for file watcher message
   # Expected: "Config file changed" or "Reloading integrations" message from Phase 1 watcher
   grep -i "config.*changed\|reloading" server.log

   # Cleanup
   kill $SERVER_PID
   ```

   This confirms the critical chain:
   - API POST → WriteIntegrationsFile (atomic write)
   - File watcher detects change (Phase 1 infrastructure)
   - Manager reloads integrations (hot-reload)

6. No other changes needed - Phase 1 already set up:
   - Manager creation with config path
   - Manager registered as lifecycle component
   - Config watcher initialized

Why this works: RegisterHandlers will now have access to configPath and manager to construct IntegrationConfigHandler. The handler will use the same config file and manager instance that Phase 1 infrastructure uses.

Why verify hot-reload: This is the critical success criterion for Phase 2. Must confirm that config changes trigger automatic reload without server restart.

  <what-built>
Complete integration management system: REST API (Plan 02-01) + React UI (Plan 02-02) + server integration (Task 1).

Backend provides CRUD endpoints with atomic config writes and health status enrichment. Frontend provides modal-based add/edit flow with connection testing and delete functionality. Config changes trigger hot-reload via Phase 1 file watcher.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Pre-verification setup:**

1. Create test config file (if not exists):
   ```bash
   cat > integrations.yaml <<EOF
   schema_version: v1
   instances: []
   EOF
   ```

2. Start server with config flag:
   ```bash
   ./spectre server --integrations-config ./integrations.yaml
   ```
   Server should start without errors

3. Open browser to Spectre UI (typically http://localhost:8080 or similar)

**Verification steps:**

**Step 1: Empty state display**
- Navigate to /integrations page
- Expected: See original mock integration tiles (Slack, PagerDuty, Grafana, etc)
- Expected: See "+ Add Integration" button at top right (NOT disabled anymore)

**Step 2: Add integration flow**
- Click "+ Add Integration" button
- Expected: Modal opens with integration form
- Fill in fields:
  - Name: "test-victorialogs"
  - Type: Select "VictoriaLogs" from dropdown
  - Enabled: Check the checkbox (should be default checked)
  - URL: "http://localhost:9428"

**Step 3: Test connection (will fail - VictoriaLogs not running)**
- Click "Test Connection" button
- Expected: Button shows "Testing..." during request
- Expected: Red error message appears (connection refused or timeout)
- This is CORRECT - we're not running VictoriaLogs, just verifying test endpoint works

**Step 4: Save integration**
- Click "Save" button (should work even with failed test)
- Expected: Modal closes
- Expected: Tiles disappear, table appears
- Expected: Table shows one row with:
  - Name: test-victorialogs
  - Type: victorialogs
  - URL: http://localhost:9428
  - Date Added: Today's date
  - Status: Red dot + "Degraded" or "Stopped" (connection failed)

**Step 5: Config persistence**
- Check integrations.yaml file:
  ```bash
  cat integrations.yaml
  ```
- Expected: File contains new instance with correct fields
- Expected: schema_version: v1, instances array with one entry

**Step 6: Edit integration**
- Click on table row
- Expected: Modal opens with pre-filled values
- Expected: Delete button visible in footer (left side, red styling)
- Change URL to: "http://localhost:9429"
- Click "Save"
- Expected: Table updates with new URL

**Step 7: Hot-reload verification**
- With server still running, edit integrations.yaml manually:
  ```bash
  # Change URL in file to a different value
  sed -i 's|localhost:9429|localhost:9999|' integrations.yaml
  ```
- Wait 2 seconds (file watcher debounce + reload time)
- Check server logs for reload message:
  ```bash
  # Look for Phase 1 watcher output
  grep -i "config.*changed\|reload" server.log
  ```
- Refresh browser page
- Expected: Table shows updated URL (http://localhost:9999) from file
- This confirms WriteIntegrationsFile → file watcher → hot-reload chain works

**Step 8: Delete integration**
- Click on table row to open edit modal
- Click "Delete" button (red, left side of footer)
- Expected: Confirmation dialog appears with integration name
- Click "OK" in dialog
- Expected: Modal closes
- Expected: Table disappears, mock tiles reappear (empty state)
- Check config file:
  ```bash
  cat integrations.yaml
  ```
- Expected: instances array is empty []

**Expected behavior summary:**
- ✅ Modal opens/closes correctly
- ✅ Form validation works (required fields)
- ✅ Test connection endpoint responds (fail is OK)
- ✅ Save creates/updates config file atomically
- ✅ Delete button shows in edit mode with confirmation
- ✅ Delete removes integration and updates file
- ✅ Table displays integrations with status
- ✅ File watcher triggers reload on manual file edit
- ✅ Hot-reload confirmed by grep on server logs
- ✅ Empty state ↔ table state transitions work

**Known acceptable behaviors:**
- Status shows "Degraded" or "Stopped" (VictoriaLogs not running - expected)
- Test connection fails (no real service - expected)

  <resume-signal>
Reply with:
- "approved" if all verification steps pass (especially Step 7 hot-reload)
- Describe specific issues if any step fails (e.g., "Modal doesn't open", "Hot-reload not working", "Delete button missing")

After Task 1 completes and before human verification:

1. **Server builds:**
   ```bash
   go build ./cmd/spectre
   echo "Exit code: $?"
   ```
   Exit code 0 (success)

2. **UI builds:**
   ```bash
   cd ui && npm run build
   echo "Exit code: $?"
   ```
   Exit code 0 (success)

3. **Routes registered:**
   ```bash
   go run ./cmd/spectre server --help 2>&1 | grep integrations-config
   ```
   Shows flag documentation

4. **Hot-reload chain testable:**
   ```bash
   # Automated test before human verification
   ./spectre server --integrations-config ./test.yaml > test.log 2>&1 &
   sleep 2
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/config/integrations \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"test","type":"victorialogs","enabled":true,"config":{"url":"http://localhost:9428"}}'
   sleep 1
   grep -i "reload\|changed" test.log
   pkill -f "spectre server"
   ```
   Log should show file watcher activity

Human verification (Task 2) confirms end-to-end flow works correctly including hot-reload.
