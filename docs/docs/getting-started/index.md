# Getting Started

Get up and running with Spectre in your Kubernetes cluster in just a few minutes.

## Overview

This section will guide you through:
- Installing Spectre using Helm
- Running Spectre locally with demo data
- Accessing the web UI
- Running your first query

## Quick Links

- [Quick Start](./quick-start) - Install and run Spectre using Helm
- [Demo Mode](./demo-mode) - Try Spectre with embedded sample data

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A Kubernetes cluster (version 1.20+)
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- Helm 3+ (for Helm installation)
- Or Docker (for local demo mode)

## Choose Your Path

### I want to try Spectre quickly
→ Start with [Demo Mode](./demo-mode) to explore Spectre without deploying to a real cluster

### I want to install in my cluster
→ Follow the [Quick Start](./quick-start) guide for Helm installation

### I want more control over installation
→ See the [Installation](../installation) section for Docker, Kubernetes manifests, and local development options
