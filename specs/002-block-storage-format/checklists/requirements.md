# Specification Quality Checklist: Block-based Storage Format with Advanced Indexing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-25
**Feature**: [Block-based Storage Format Specification](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass validation. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Key strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1/P2)
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects of block-based format
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Clear assumptions documented
- Good coverage of edge cases

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning
